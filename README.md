* I am currently engaged in adapting [word clocks](https://github.com/ednieuw/WordclockSelector) and [Fibonacci clocks](https://github.com/ednieuw/Fibonacci-Nano-ESP32-clock) from the Arduino Nano to the Arduino ESP32 Nano, utilizing BLE and WIFI for MCU control.
* [PCB designs](https://github.com/ednieuw/NanoESP32PCB) and [instructions](https://github.com/ednieuw/NanoESP32-BW-RGBW-clock/tree/main) for the [ESP32 word clocks](https://github.com/ednieuw/Arduino-ESP32-Nano-Wordclock).<br>[Use the word clock selector](https://github.com/ednieuw/WordclockSelector) for an overview of possibilities.
* I am also learning to operate [various displays](https://github.com/ednieuw/ESP32-C3-Clock-and-more) with ESP32-C3, S3, and S6 MCUs, [Flipdiscs](https://github.com/ednieuw/FlipDiscClock) and [watches](https://github.com/ednieuw/Lilygo-T-Watch-2020).
* As a retired chemical technologist with 43 years of experience leading a team and heading an immunological laboratory specialized in immunoglobulins and complement, I have a passion for development and automation. My career involved developing RIA, ELISA, and nephelometry assays. The [Logit](https://github.com/ednieuw/ELISA-logit-regression) and [PLA](https://github.com/ednieuw/PLA_tredecim) Excel worksheets are still maintained. [Calibration programs overview](https://github.com/ednieuw/Calibration)<br>
* My journey in automation began with the HP9815 RPN calculator, progressing to the Acorn BBC Micro, and then to Lattice and Borland C on MS-DOS/Windows OS, including creating small LIMS with MS Office Visual Basic applications.
