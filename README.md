* I am currently engaged in adapting word- and Fibonacci-clocks from the Arduino Nano to the Arduino ESP32 Nano, utilizing BLE and WIFI for MCU control.
* I am also learning to operate various displays with ESP32-C3, S3, and S6 MCUs.
* As a retired chemical technologist with 43 years of experience leading a team and heading an immunological laboratory specialized in immunoglobulins and complement, I have a passion for development and automation. <br>
My career involved innovating tests with RIA, ELISA, and nephelometry. <br>
My journey in automation began with the HP9815 RPN calculator, progressing to the Acorn BBC Micro, and then to Lattice and Borland C on MS-DOS/Windows OS, including creating small LIMS with MS Office Visual Basic applications.
